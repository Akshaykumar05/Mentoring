## Describe in detail difference between Virtualization and Containerization
### Virtualization
* Isolation of operating system.
* It refers to the process of using software to create a virtual resource that runs on a layer separate from the physical hardware. The most common use case of virtualization is cloud computing.
* In this process we create a virtual computer having existence of hardware and runs on a VM with some specifications such as Memory.

### Containerization
* Isolation of an application.
* Containerization is the process of packaging every component needed to run an application or microservice, including associated libraries. Each container consists of codes, dependencies, and the OS itself. It allows applications to run the same way on multiple platforms.
